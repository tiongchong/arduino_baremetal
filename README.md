# Arduino baremetal

2025/10/15 
- on this one fine day, I like to try out Arduino in the baremetal c approach.
- so i downloaded AVR toolchain - https://www.microchip.com/en-us/tools-resources/develop/microchip-studio/gcc-compilers
- and build avrdude from source - https://github.com/avrdudes/avrdude

- my first blinky project, tested working using Arduino Nano.
